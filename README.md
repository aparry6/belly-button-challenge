The repository contains the following files:

index.html: This file serves as the entry point for the web application. It includes the necessary HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript code to create the visualizations.
style.css: This file contains the custom CSS styles for the web application.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code for fetching the JSON data, creating the dropdown menu, and generating the visualizations.
Usage

Upon opening the index.html file in a web browser, you will see a dropdown menu that allows you to select different data samples. The initial visualization displays the demographic panel, bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart for the first sample.

Dropdown Menu: Use the dropdown menu to select different data samples. The visualizations will update dynamically based on your selection.
Demographic Panel: The demographic panel displays metadata information related to the selected data sample.
Bar Chart: The bar chart represents the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their corresponding sample values.
Bubble Chart: The bubble chart displays the distribution of OTUs based on their IDs and sample values.
Gauge Chart: The gauge chart visualizes the belly button washing frequency, represented as the number of scrubs per week.
